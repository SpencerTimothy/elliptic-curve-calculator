# elliptic-curve-calculator
A calculator for computing points on an elliptic curves

This caclulator is a work in progress. It is a calculator I created from scratch to help with computations in my cryptogrophy math class.  
As of right now this calculator only works with a specifuc elliptic curve, but can be modified by changing the equations in the code.

Future changes to make will include a raw_input() to prompt the user to enter the equation for the elliptic curve being used, as well
as the initial conditions on the elliptic curve.  Hopefully when this project is completed this calculator will one day compute all the
points P, 2P, 3P, ..., nP until the order for the elliptic curve is calculated. As well as a raw_input() funtion, this would also include
a loop to compute all points until it has found the order for the initial point and terminating the program.
